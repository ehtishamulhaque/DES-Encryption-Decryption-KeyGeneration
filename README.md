## DES-Encryption-Decryption-KeyGeneration

# C++ Implentation of DES (Encryptor, Decryptor & Key Generator)
That can print and varifty the following flow diagram 

If plaintext into S-DES Encryptor is F2 (hex) & cipher key is 26E (hex):-

That can find & show the following in hex on the Encryption, Decryption & Key Generation Functions flow diagrams.
(assume final output of Encryptor is applied as input to Decryptor).
 
 1. Round key for Round#1
 2. Round key for Round#2
 3. Output of 1st round of Encryptor.
 4. Output of 2nd round of Encryptor.
 5. Output of 1st  round of Decryptor.
 6. Output of 2nd round of Decryptor.
 

# Practical implentation can be seen in docs file.
