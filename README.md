## DES-Encryption-Decryption-KeyGeneration

# Data Encryption Standard (DES)
C++ Implementation of DES (Encryptor, Decryptor & Key Generator) that can display and verify the following flow diagram:

If the plaintext input into the S-DES Encryptor is F2 (hex) and the cipher key is 26E (hex):

The implementation should be able to find and display the following in hexadecimal format within the Encryption, Decryption, and Key Generation Functions flow diagrams (assuming the final output of the Encryptor is applied as input to the Decryptor):

1. Round key for Round #1.
2. Round key for Round #2.
3. Output of the 1st round of Encryptor.
4. Output of the 2nd round of Encryptor.
5. Output of the 1st round of Decryptor.
6. Output of the 2nd round of Decryptor.


# Practical
The practical implementation can be viewed in the documentation file."
